FLOW FANTASY FUSION - FORTE HACKS SUBMISSION
================================================================================

PROJECT NAME
------------
Flow Fantasy Fusion

TAGLINE
-------
AI-powered cross-ecosystem fantasy sports dApp with automated settlements on Flow

ONE-PARAGRAPH PITCH
-------------------
Flow Fantasy Fusion revolutionizes fantasy sports by combining blockchain transparency, AI-powered lineup optimization, and automated settlements. Built on Flow blockchain with Forte Actions and Scheduled Transactions, our platform allows users to create custom fantasy leagues, stake FLOW tokens or NBA Top Shot NFTs, receive intelligent lineup suggestions from our rule-based AI, and have matches automatically settled and payouts distributed without manual intervention. We solve the fragmentation of fantasy sports and NFT collectibles by creating a unified, trustless, and automated platform where players compete with real on-chain assets and enjoy provably fair outcomes.

TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS
--------------------
1. **Cadence Smart Contracts** (LeagueFactory, StakingManager, Settlement)
   - Resource-oriented programming for safe asset handling
   - Escrow system with max stake limits and token whitelisting
   - Event emissions for all major state changes
   
2. **Forte Actions Integration**
   - "Stake and Schedule Settlement" composite action
   - Safety metadata with validation rules
   - Composable workflow chaining (stake → AI → settle)
   
3. **Scheduled Transactions**
   - Automatic settlement triggering at league end time
   - Performance-based score calculation
   - Smart contract-enforced payout distribution (60%/25%/15% split)
   
4. **AI Lineup Predictor**
   - Rule-based scoring algorithm weighing:
     * Recent performance (45%)
     * NFT market value (30%)
     * Consistency (15%)
     * Trending data (10%)
   - Three optimization strategies (balanced, high-risk, conservative)
   - Explainable AI with confidence scores and rationale
   
5. **Full-Stack Architecture**
   - React frontend with FCL wallet integration
   - Express backend with caching and rate limiting
   - Flask AI service with RESTful API
   - Cross-origin support for composability

6. **Multi-Asset Support**
   - FLOW, FUSD, USDC token staking
   - NBA Top Shot NFT integration
   - Configurable token whitelist per league

REPRODUCTION GUIDE
------------------
Prerequisites:
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.8+
- Flow CLI installed
- Flow testnet account with FLOW tokens

Step 1: Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/flow-fantasy-fusion.git
cd flow-fantasy-fusion
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

Step 2: Configure Environment
- Copy .env.example to .env
- Add your Flow testnet private key and address
- Update contract addresses after deployment

Step 3: Deploy Smart Contracts
```bash
bash scripts/deploy_contracts.sh
```
- Note the deployed contract addresses
- Update .env and frontend/.env with addresses

Step 4: Start Services
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend API
npm run dev:backend

# Terminal 2: AI Service  
npm run dev:ai

# Terminal 3: Frontend
npm run dev:frontend
```

Step 5: Test the Application
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Connect Wallet" and connect Flow wallet
3. Navigate to "Create League" and create a test league
4. Join the league by staking tokens
5. Request AI lineup suggestion
6. View scheduled settlement in league details
7. Check dashboard for your active leagues and stats

Step 6: Run Integration Tests
```bash
bash scripts/test_flow.sh
```

Step 7: Execute Forte Action
```bash
# Stake 25.5 FLOW and schedule settlement 7 days from now
bash scripts/run_forte_action.sh 1 25.5 FLOW $(date -d '+7 days' +%s)
```

Expected Results:
- All contracts deployed successfully on testnet
- Frontend loads and allows wallet connection
- Leagues can be created and joined
- AI service returns lineup suggestions with scores
- Transactions visible on Flow testnet explorer
- Settlement scheduled for future execution

Troubleshooting:
- If contracts fail to deploy, check TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY in .env
- If AI service fails, ensure Python dependencies installed: pip install -r ai/requirements.txt
- If frontend doesn't connect, verify VITE_FLOW_ACCESS_NODE in frontend/.env
- Check all services are running on correct ports (3000, 3001, 5000)
